# Julia_versus_OpenMP
-A comprehensive evaluation of Julia's parallel programming approaches in comparison to C/OpenMP, under [PolyBench/C](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~pouchet/software/polybench/), the Polyhedral Benchmark suite;\
-Empirical data on performance characteristics across different computational patterns;\
-Guidelines for selecting optimal parallelization strategies based on problem characteristics(Polybench);\
-Insights into scaling behavior from workstation-class hardware to HPC environments;\
-Identification of potential improvements for Julia's parallel computing ecosystem;\
